        <p>
          The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing
          through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French
          House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf
          Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne
          Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of ground 60 miles directly south
          of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men
          realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also
          established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in
          1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile
          celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile),
          similar to those that form our current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted
          until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded
          from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's
          head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an
          actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat
          fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
        </p>
        <p>
          New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi
          Gras was celebrated openly in New Orleans, but not with the parades we
          know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de
          Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model
          for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
        </p>
        <p>
          The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781
          report to the Spanish colonial governing body. That year, the
          Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of
          hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with
          carriages and horseback riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling
          gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members
          and lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856,
          six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking
          John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus
          brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known
          as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was
          formed. This is also the first recorded account of Mardi Gras
          "throws."
        </p>
        <p>
          Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they
          even printed "Carnival Edition" lithographs of parades' fantastic
          float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were
          always carefully guarded before the procession). At first, these
          reproductions were small, and details could not be clearly seen. But
          beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds,"
          these chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated color,
          doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase,
          Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was
          brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges
          Soulie', who for 40 years was responsible for creating all of
          Carnival's floats and processional outfits.
        </p>
        <p>
          1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of
          Carnival, Rex, to preside over the first daytime parade. To honor the
          visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen
          introduced Romanoff's family colors of purple, green and gold as
          Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for justice; gold for power;
          and green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that
          Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented,
          due in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New
          Orleans instead of France, culminating with Comus' magnificent "The
          Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic
          paper-mache' animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock
          both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry
          Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making
          Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which it still is.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes
          today developed from private social clubs with restrictive membership
          policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely
          funded by their members, New Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free
          Show on Earth!"

        <h2>LaToya Cantrell - Mayor of New Orleans</h2>
        <p>
          LaToya Cantrell (n√©e Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American
          politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana since May 7,
          2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
          Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New
          Orleans City Council from 2012‚Äì2018.
        </p>
        <h3>New Orleans City Council</h3>
        <p>
          In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City
          Council seat vacated when former District B representative Stacy Head
          won an election to an at-large position. After the November election,
          candidate Dana Kaplan and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff,
          which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote. Cantrell served out
          the balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year
          term in 2014. As a council member, Cantrell focused on health,
          housing, and criminal-justice issues. She introduced a bill banning
          smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health
          effects of secondhand smoke on service industry workers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015. Also in 2015,
          Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move
          that was objected to by residents because of its proposed placement in
          Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the shelter was moved to the
          downtown site of the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced
          legislation with at-large council member Jason Williams to register
          and inspect rental units in the city. As a member of the Criminal
          Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install
          crime cameras in her district, assess the effectiveness of citywide
          anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address understaffing at the New
          Orleans Police Department.
        </p>
        <h3>Mayor of New Orleans</h3>
        <p>
          Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to
          hold the position in the city's history. Once in office, she
          established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of
          creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city.
          Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
          finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate
          hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has
          focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure,
          public transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As part of that
          initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit
          against four opioid manufacturers and distributors. During the 2019
          session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair
          Share Agreement with Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and
          tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront
          funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in
          annual recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval of the
          Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals
          Cantrell and the City Council put on the ballot in the 2019 general
          election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on
          short-term rental properties, as well the establishment of a Human
          Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter
        </p>
        <h3>Awards</h3>
        <p>
          In 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement award by the
          presidents of Tulane, Loyola and Xavier universities and the
          University of New Orleans for her service to the community.
        </p>
        <h3>2021 mayoral election</h3>
        <p>
          Cantrell was re-elected to office by a wide margin in November 2021,
          securing 65% of the vote. Her campaign focused on the city's status in
          2020 as a COVID-19 hotspot and her efforts, which at times were
          unpopular, to stop the disease's spread. She also stressed the need
          for higher-paying jobs for city workers, better public health outcomes
          and new technologies for the future of New Orleans.
